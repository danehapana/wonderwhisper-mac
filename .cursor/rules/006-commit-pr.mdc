# Commit & PR Guidelines

- **Commits**: small, focused, imperative subjects (e.g., `fix: prevent crash when mic permission denied`).
- **PRs**: link issues; describe scope, approach, and risks; include screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
- **Checks**: ensure build, tests, and lint pass locally before requesting review.
